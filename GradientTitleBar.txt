This is an enhancement of Gradient Title Bar module.
I've added the choice to use System colours by including the respective API constants.
I also have simplified the usage by adding the SetBarColours routine, before in the form, now in the module.


The original module was downloaded from:

When you test the project must close the form through it´s close button or dialog box or VB will crash.
